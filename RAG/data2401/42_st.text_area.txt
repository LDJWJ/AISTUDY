Function signature[source] st.text_area(label, value="", height=None, max_chars=None, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, placeholder=None, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible") Parameters

label
(str)
 
A short label explaining to the user what this input is for.
The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following
elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.
This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1:  and :sunglasses:.
For a list of all supported codes,
see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$"
must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed
at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored],
where color needs to be replaced with any of the following
supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render.
Display unsupported elements as literal characters by
backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.
For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="")
but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow
empty labels by raising an exception.


value
(object or None)
 
The text value of this widget when it first renders. This will be
cast to str internally. If None, will initialize empty and
return None until the user provides input. Defaults to empty string.


height
(int or None)
 
Desired height of the UI element expressed in pixels. If None, a
default height is used.


max_chars
(int or None)
 
Maximum number of characters allowed in text area.


key
(str or int)
 
An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget.
If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget
based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may
not share the same key.


help
(str)
 
An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the textarea.


on_change
(callable)
 
An optional callback invoked when this text_area's value changes.


args
(tuple)
 
An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.


kwargs
(dict)
 
An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.


placeholder
(str or None)
 
An optional string displayed when the text area is empty. If None,
no text is displayed.


disabled
(bool)
 
An optional boolean, which disables the text area if set to True.
The default is False.


label_visibility
("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")
 
The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there
is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label="").
If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is
"visible".
Returns(str or None)  The current value of the text area widget or None if no value has been
provided by the user.

    "was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the "
    "season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of "
    "despair, (...)",
    )
