st.experimental_user is dependant on the host platform running the
Streamlit app. If the host platform has not configured the function, it
will behave as it does in a locally running app.

Get user info as a dictionary.
Attributes

email
(str)

"test@example.com".
If running on Streamlit Community Cloud, this
property returns one of two values:

None if the user is not logged in or not a member of the app's        workspace. Such users appear under anonymous pseudonyms in the app's        analytics.
The user's email if the the user is logged in and a member of the        app's workspace. Such users are identified by their email in the app's        analytics.


Examples
The ability to personalize apps for the user viewing the app is a great way to make your app more engaging.
It unlocks a plethora of use-cases for developers, some of which could include: showing additional controls for admins, visualizing a user's Streamlit history, a personalized stock ticker, a chatbot app, and much more. We're excited to see what you build with this feature!
Here's a code snippet that shows extra buttons for admins:
# Show extra buttons for admin users.
ADMIN_USERS = {
    'person1@email.com',
    'person2@email.com',
    'person3@email.com'
}
if st.experimental_user.email in ADMIN_USERS:
    display_the_extra_admin_buttons()
display_the_interface_everyone_sees()

Show different content to users based on their email address:
# Show different content based on the user's email address.
if st.experimental_user.email == 'jane@email.com':
    display_jane_content()
elif st.experimental_user.email == 'adam@foocorp.io':
    display_adam_content()
else:
    st.write("Please contact us to get access!")

Greet users with their name that's stored in a database:
# Greet the user by their name.
if st.experimental_user.email:
    # Get the user's name from the database.
    name = get_name_from_db(st.experimental_user.email)
    st.write('Hello, %s!' % name)
